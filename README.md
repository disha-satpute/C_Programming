# C - Procedure Oriented Programming 

In C programming, files are organized in a modular way to separate code into different logical parts, making it easier to manage, maintain, and reuse. The flow of how .h (header files), .c (source files), and .o (object files) work together during the compilation process follows a specific pattern.

When you write .h (header) and .c (source) files separately in C programming, this practice is known as modular programming or separation of interface and implementation.
