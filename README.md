# C - Procedure Oriented Programming 

In C programming, files are organized in a modular way to separate code into different logical parts, making it easier to manage, maintain, and reuse. 

The flow of how .h (header files), .c (source files), and .o (object files) work together during the compilation process follows a specific pattern.

When you write .h (header) and .c (source) files separately in C programming, this practice is known as **modular programming** or **separation of interface and implementation.**


- .h files (header files) declare functions, data structures, and macros to be used in multiple source files.
- .c files (source files) contain the actual code and include the .h files to use the declared functions and data structures.
- .o files (object files) are created by compiling the .c files. These files contain the compiled machine code.
- .exe files (Executable file) is the final output of our code.

- Linking: Object files are linked together to produce an executable program.
